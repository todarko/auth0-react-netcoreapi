# auth0app

## This project combines two separate tutorials for setting up React, .NET Core, and Auth0 into a single project that can all be deployed together.

### Auth0 Project Code from [Auth0 Full Stack](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/full-stack/hello-world/basic-access-control/spa/react-javascript/aspnet-core-csharp)

### .NET Project Temaple used from [VS2022 Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/javascript/tutorial-asp-net-core-with-react?view=vs-2022)

Debugging in VS2022 will start both the React frontend and .NET Core Web API

Search the project for "Auth0-" and replace these values with the ones in your Auth0 project settings account.
